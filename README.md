# Clickhouse tutorials

In this repository you will find tutorials to integrate [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) with different tools such as Terraform, dbt, Metabase, etc. The configurations used in these tutorials are completely based on my experience and requirements needed at the time of development. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use these scripts as guides for your first steps.

### ClickHouse Terraform

In `clickhouse_terraform` folder you'll find scripts required to integrate ClickHouse with Terraform and Kubernetes trough helm charts.
